                For a creature who spends 90% of its life hanging upside down, 
                you think they'd be pretty good at it by now, right? 
                Well, apparently not. Quite often, the sloth will mistake 
                his own arm for a tree branch and fall to its death. 
                A terribly tragic fate, indeed.

                Instructions: The objective of this game is for the player, 
                being a sloth, to catch as many branches as possible. 
                The speed of the falling branches will get faster, and the 
                sloth will become more anxious. To earn a life, and to calm 
                the sloth's nerves, the sloth has the opportunity to catch a falling leaf. 
                There are few leaves, so the sloth must be attentive.
