# Ironhack-Game: Sloth Saver

Concept:
Despite the negative cliches, a sloth is quite an incredible and peculiar creature. Both two and three-toed sloths can hold their breath underwater for about 40 minutes, have a vertebrae allowing them to turn their neck at almost 270Â° axis, and they consume a plant-based diet keeping them healthy for throughout their lifespan of near 30 years.

But at the end, a sloth is enevitably defeated by its flaws; for a creature who spends 90% of its life hanging upside down, you think they'd be pretty good at it by now, right? Well, apparently not. Quite often, the sloth will mistake his own arm for a tree branch and fall to its death. A terribly tragic fate, indeed. 

Instructions:
The objective of this game is for the player, being a sloth, to catch as many branches as possible. The speed of the falling branches will get faster, and the sloth will become more anxious. To earn a life, and to calm the sloth's nerves, the sloth has the opportunity to catch a falling leaf. There are few leaves, so the sloth must be attentive. 

There are three levels in the game. The game is won when level three is complete and the sloth has caught all of the branches.
